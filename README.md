# Cubify-Reddit
Makes cubes out of certain words

[After just 2 weeks my bot has earned 8947 comment karma.](http://i.imgur.com/FSgfeBc.png) ([Karma breakdown](http://i.imgur.com/3wTsQbn.png))

It picks out words with at least 5 letters, whose first and last letter are identical, its letter are alphabetic and there are spaces between each letter.

First two points are a requirement to make the cube work.

Added an experimental cube with subsquares. For now roughly 1 in every 3 comments have a subsquare (when possible). May be removed depends on feedback.

Project was inspired when I saw someone on /r/Dota2 posting a R A R E F L A I R cube. I wish I saved the link.
