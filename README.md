Makes cubes out of certain words

[After just 2 weeks my bot has earned 8947 comment karma.](http://i.imgur.com/FSgfeBc.png) ([Karma breakdown](http://i.imgur.com/3wTsQbn.png))

It picks out words with an uneven amount of letters and at least 5 letters, whose first and last letter are identical, its letter are alphabetic and there are spaces between each letter.

First two points are a requirement to make the cube work. It is possible to drop the first and last letter requirement but the cube won't look good. (It's not intuitive since you have to read the word from right to left and bottom to top.)

Project was inspired when I saw someone on /r/Dota2 posting a R A R E F L A I R cube. I wish I saved the link.
